# AA Assignment 1

Combinatorial Optiomization Problems using Exhaustive Search and a Greedy Heuristic Search.

To use with current graphs:

```bash
make all
make plots
make tables
```

For also generate graphs:

```bash
make graphs
make all
make plots
make tables
```

Can also run algorithms independently:

```bash
make greedysearch
```

or

```bash
make exsearch
```
